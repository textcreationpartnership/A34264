            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Conformiſts Reaſons for hearing and joining with the Nonconformiſts.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE ſame Reaſons which oblige Perſons to hear and join with us, oblige us alſo to take all Opportunities of hearing and joining with the Nonconformiſts, they being Miniſters of Chriſt, having due Call and Authority from him to preach the Goſpel. The Church hath real need of their Labours, their Miniſtry is hated by Satan and Saint-hating Men; they are duly ſubject to the higher Powers, and are protected by the Law of the Land in the courſe of their Miniſtry, and are a conſiderable part of that ſame Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which their preſent Majeſties under God are Supream Governours of, according to the old Oath of Supremacy, and the <hi>37th</hi> Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe Words of our Saviour's take place here; <hi>He that is not againſt us, is on our part,</hi> Mark 9. 40. The Nonconformiſts <hi>really</hi> are not againſt us, therefore they are on our part. The Scope and Drift of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is to win Souls not to this or that Sect, but to Chriſt, to teach them their Duty to God, and to their preſent Majeſties, as ſole Supream under God, and the common Center of Catholick Unity in theſe Nations. They are truly tender of our Miniſtry, rejoice in our Labours, and in the Gifts and Graces of able and faithful Conformiſts, rebuke Backbiters and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifyers of our Miniſtry; and as they have opportunity, hear and join with us and our Churches.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the time of the late King <hi>James</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> did confeſs its Error in being ſevere to the Nonconformiſts. This is plain from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pamphlet publiſhed in the late King's Reign, intituled, <hi>A Letter to a Diſſenter, upon occaſion of his Majeſties late gracious Declaration of Indulgence.</hi> The Words thereof, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. are theſe following; <hi>The Church of</hi> England <hi>convinced of its Error in being ſevere to you; the Parliament, whenever it meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, will ſure be gentle to you: the next Heir bred in the Country, which you have ſo often quoted for a Pattern of Indulgence: A general Agreement of all think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, that we muſt no more cut our ſelves off from the Proteſtants abroad, but rather inlarge the Foundations upon which we are to build our Defences againſt the common Enemy; ſo that in truth all things ſeem to conſpire to give you Eaſe and Satisfaction,</hi> &amp;c. This is to be looked upon as the general ſenſe of the conforming Nobility, Gentry, Commonalty, and Clergy in the time of the late King's Reign: for ſo really it was, as is well known. Now here
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47268:2"/> the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth confeſs its Error towards the Diſſenters, and to have erred not in ſome ſlight and trivial Matters, but in Matters touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundation; and ſees a neceſſity of inlarging its Foundations, and conſequently of taking in the Nonconformiſts, and making them conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Parts of the Church with her ſelf. Either then the Nonconformiſts are upon one and the ſame Foundation with our ſelves, or they deſerve to be, and it is through no fault of theirs that they are not: being upon the ſame Foundation, we cannot be againſt their Miniſtry and Meetings; but we muſt needs be againſt our own; and overthrow the Common Proteſtant Cauſe, Religion, and Intereſt in this Nation, and conſequently in all other Nations and Countries, what in us lies; and in being for their Miniſtry, we are for our own.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Theſe Scriptures ſet together, prove it a Duty, <hi>viz. Hear, and your Soul ſhall live,</hi> Iſa. 55. 3. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them,</hi> Mat. 18. 20. <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1, 2. <hi>Though I be free from all Men, yet have I made my ſelf Servant unto all, that I might gain the more: And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the Law as under the Law, that I might gain them that are under the Law; to them that are without Law, (being not without Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt) that I might gain them that are without Law: To the Weak became I as weak, that I might gain the Weak. I am made all things to all Men, that I might by all means ſave ſome: And this I do for the Goſpel's Sake,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> is a principal Part of the Catechiſm, and of the common Creed of Chriſtendom; it is a Fundamental in true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, moſt frequently repeated in all Conforming Congregations. Now we do not duly believe and practiſe this Fundamental, unleſs we hear and join with the Nonconforming Brethren in the Word, and Prayer, and Sacraments, as we have Call and Opportunity, they being viſible Saints, and there being nothing in their way of Worſhip, but what is either lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable or tolerable: God doth own and approve their Miniſtry and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and is graciouſly preſent with them.</p>

               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 1.</label> The Presbyterian Miniſters refuſe Subjection to the Governours of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore it cannot be ſafe for us to hear and join with them.
<label>Anſw.</label> This is plainly not true: for under God their preſent Majeſties are ſole Supream Governours of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ruling all Eſtates according to Laws enacted by common Conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; witneſs the old Oath of Supremacy, and the <hi>37th</hi> Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>The King's Majeſty hath the chief Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47268:2"/> in this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and other his Dominions. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom the chief Government of all Eſtates of this Realm, whether they be Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, in all Cauſes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be ſubject to any foreign Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</hi> The Presbyterians generally ſubſcribe this Article, and it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious that they are duly ſubject to their preſent Majeſties, pray heartily for them, pay Taxes bear all legal Charges, keep the ſtated monthly Faſts ſtrictly and ſolemnly, and are more upright and cordial to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government than many of the Conformiſts are. If you deny their preſent Majeſties to be chief Governours of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you then bring in the Papacy, and unhinge the Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 2.</label> Though the King be ſupream Governour by the Sword, yet Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are ſupream Governours of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the Word.
<label>Anſw.</label> Biſhops have no Authority but what is miniſterial and ſubordinate, and therefore they cannot be ſupream Governours: they are under Law to God, and they are under Law to the King as God's Vicegerent. If you ſuppoſe them ſupream Governours of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> you ſuppoſe them Popes, that is, Antichriſtian Prelates, exalting themſelves above God, and above the King his Vicegerent. <hi>Abiathar</hi> the High-Prieſt was not ſuperior to, nor coordinate with King <hi>Solomon,</hi> but his Subject, and therefore for his Crime was juſtly depoſed by him, and <hi>Zadok</hi> put in his room.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 3.</label> The Presbyterian Miniſters have not juſt and valid Ordination, as being ordained by meer Presbyters without a Biſhop.
<label>Anſw.</label> God hath no where declared that there cannot be juſt and valid Ordination without a Biſhop, and therefore the contrary Doctrine muſt needs be erroneous. Accordingly all true Proteſtants own and approve Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by Presbyters without a Biſhop, (as is uſed in the Dutch, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian, French, and <hi>New-England</hi>-Churches) to be juſt and valid, and not defective in any thing abſolutely neceſſary. The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> doth not allow the Ordination of Presbyters by a Biſhop only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the preſence and concurrence of co-aſſiſtant Presbyters, who do equally impoſe Hands with the Biſhop: And the Presbyterians do not allow Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by all Presbyters promiſcuouſly, but only by ſenior Presbyters, ſuch as for their Age, Experience, Gravity, Wiſdom, miniſterial Ability and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and exemplary Vertues, are Heads and chief Men among them, and a kind of Fathers to the younger Sort. The principal thing in a Miniſter of Chriſt is not external Ordination, but miniſterial Ability and Fidelity; external Ordination is not principal but ſubſervient: And where is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Ability and Fidelity, with the conſent and liking of the People, and the protection and countenance or permiſſion of the Magiſtrate, with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands, and Faſting and Prayer by ſenior Presbyters of known Wiſdom, Gravity, Piety, and exemplary Vertue and Ability; either this is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47268:3"/> juſt and valid Ordination, or there is no ſuch thing as Ordination, neither can it be declared what it is. Now this is the Ordination in uſe among the Presbyterians. And indeed able and faithful Presbyters are, according to Scripture-phraſe, Biſhops; <hi>Acts 20. 17. 28. Phil. 1. 1. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 4.</label> We who are conforming Miniſters cannot hear and join with the Nonconformiſts without breach of our Oath of Canonical Obedience to the Ordinary.
<label>Anſw.</label> That Oath binds us but to obey the Ordinary in things lawful and honeſt: And to hear and join with the Nonconformiſts as we have opportunity, is neither againſt Law nor Honeſty, but rather laudable, pleaſing to God, profitable to the Soul, and the true way of Peace. The Ordinary is not ſupream; but an Officer appointed by the King and State touching Church-matters, he is under God, and to the King and State: If he enjoin or forbid us any thing contrary to Law, we owe him no Obedience. Our Oath to him binds us to no new Duty, but only binds us more ſtrictly to do what we had been bound by the Law to do, in caſe we had not taken that Oath. The ſame ſupream Authority which makes the Ordinary, and gives him limited Power over us, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the Preamble of the late Act for Toleration, that the Liberty now enjoyed by the Nonconformiſts, <hi>may be an effectual means to unite their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Proteſtant Subjects in Intereſt and Affection.</hi> Now our hearing and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Nonconformiſts, is a countenancing of them, and of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Liberty, and conſequently it tendeth to the union of Proteſtants in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Affection, in the Judgment of the King and Queen, and of both Houſes of Parliament, and conſequently of the Ordinary himſelf; for by the Ordinary is meant the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, who is one of the Houſe of Lords, and ſo hath a hand in making the Law. How can we diſobey the Biſhop by hearing and joining with thoſe Men, unto whom the Biſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as a Member of the Houſe of Lords, doth by his conſent to the Act of Parliament, give free Liberty, as an effectual means of uniting Proteſtants in Intereſt and Affection, and exempteth them from all Penalties, and from being proſecuted in any Eccleſiſtical Court, for or by reaſon of noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the Church of <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 5.</label> The Nonconformiſts are againſt all Church-Government by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and there can be no Church without a Biſhop.
<label>Anſw.</label> The Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts are not againſt all Church-Government by Biſhops, for they have long deſired that famous Arch-biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Model of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by Biſhops and Presbyters might be eſtabliſhed among us. But hitherto they could not obtain it, for there are a party of Men in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome Clergy and ſome Laity, by Profeſſion Proteſtants, whom the Piety and moderation of ſuch Biſhops as Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> doth greatly offend, and can by no means pleaſe. A limited Epiſcopacy the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47268:3"/> Nonconformiſts generally are not againſt; try and ſee if they will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and willingly conform to Arch-biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi>'s Model. That there may be a Church without a Biſhop is plain from the Dutch, Helvetian, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant French Churches, and thoſe in <hi>New-England.</hi> There is alſo the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church on Earth, and yet no one univerſal Paſtor and Biſhop on Earth. The Pope indeed claims to be ſo, but for that he is by Proteſtants juſtly charged with Antichriſtian Pride and Ambition. There is alſo the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as comprizing all the Chriſtian People in <hi>England;</hi> but no one Man is univerſal Biſhop to all the Chriſtian People in <hi>England,</hi> nor are all the Biſhops put together Governours of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but they are ſubject to the King and Queen, and governed by Laws, made by the King and Parliament, as hath been declared: and therefore it is not true, that there can be no Church without a Biſhop. The Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth by Chriſtian Faith, Hope, and Love, not as excluſive of Paſtors and Miniſters, but as ſuppoſing and including them as God's Inſtruments for begetting and finiſhing theſe heavenly Graces: and nothing hinders but that able and faithful Presbyters may be inſtrumental in God's Hands for begetting and finiſhing theſe heavenly Graces in thouſands of Souls, yea and much better than ſome Biſhops, ſuch as either cannot or will not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Word and Doctrine, Popiſh Biſhops, who are Idolaters, and ſuch other as ſeek themſelves and not the things of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 6.</label> The Nonconformiſts have no Ceremonies in their way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<label>Anſw.</label> Yes, but they have two Ceremonies of God's own ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Baptiſm, and the Inſtitution of Bread and Wine; and if God had not thought theſe two enough, he could eaſily have ordained more; but he thought good to ordain no more, and it muſt needs be a wiſe and ſafe way to keep to God's Ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 7.</label> The Nonconformiſts have no publick Liturgy, that is, no ſtinted form of publick Prayer and Adminiſtration of Sacraments.
<label>Anſw.</label> You will give the Miniſter leave to chuſe his Text, and compoſe and methodize his Sermon; why can you not alſo leave him to perform the other part of miniſterial Office, reſpecting Prayer, Thankſgiving, and the Sacraments, by a ſtinted form or not, as he himſelf is beſt able and thinks moſt meet? If his Words be grave, ſound, ſcriptural, pious, ſuited to common Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, though not to each ones Fancy, your Duty is to mind your Heart, to purify that from Pride and carnal Prejudice, and evil Thoughts, and affectionately to concur and join in all the Service, and be thankful. It is very deſirable that all Miniſters were of ſuch Abilities, and at all times ſo prompt and full, as to need no ſtinted Form in publick; let thoſe who are ſo able, not be abridged of their Liberty beyond their own choice and Chriſtian Prudence. The Nonconformiſts keep to Chriſt's own Words
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47268:4"/> in the Act of Baptiſm, and they recite the Words of Chriſt touching the Lord's Supper, and they keep to a ſtinted Form in Singing Pſalms, and they read God's own Word in their Aſſemblies; and if they be able to preach they are able to pray, and to ſuit their Prayer to the Edification of that People over whom they are ſet, and to whom they miniſter. And therefore this can be no juſt Exception; they think they have much more reaſon to except againſt our way as being too much in ſtinted Forms.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 8.</label> We who are Conformiſts cannot hear and join with the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts without condemning our own way.
<label>Anſw.</label> It doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that becauſe our Way is good, therefore their Way is not good; for as to external Modes and Forms and Things circumſtantial Siſter-Churches, and Neighbour-Congregations may differ, and yet both be good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Twenty Miniſters at the ſame time in diſtant Congregations may hit upon the ſame Text, and deliver the ſame ſubſtantial Doctrine, and yet their Words and Method and Compoſure may wonderfully vary, and all may be good and uſeful, and God more glorified by ſuch Variety than otherwiſe. Moſt conforming Congregations have no Organs, ſome have; muſt therefore one of the two neceſſarily be bad and damnable? The Churches in <hi>Holland,</hi> the Churches in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> the Churches in <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Churches in <hi>Denmark,</hi> the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> the Proteſtant French Churches have different ways, and modes, and forms, as to external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. If one be good, muſt we therefore condemn all the reſt as ſinful? What is ſinful and forbidden by God, we may in no wiſe conform to; but what is neither preciſely commanded nor preciſely forbidden by God, may be done or not done, according as Chriſtian Prudence ſhall dictate to be moſt convenient: in ſuch Caſes and Matters we are after the Example of <hi>Paul,</hi> to be all things to all Men; and if we come to an Epiſcopal Church, do as they do; if we come to a Presbyterian Church, do as they do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> adviſed <hi>Auguſtine; Ad quamcunque eccleſiam veneris, ejus morem ſerva, ſi, &amp;c.</hi> To what Church ſoever thou ſhalt come, obſerve its way and manner, if thou wouldſt neither offend others, nor have others to offend thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 9.</label> If the Nonconformiſts will preach in the Church, I will readily hear them; but to hear them in Barns and private Houſes, and the like places, I like not, I am againſt it.
<label>Anſw.</label> We cannot follow a better Pattern than Chriſt: Now he preached not only in the Temple and Synagogue, but in private Houſes, and ſometimes upon a Mountain, and by the Sea-ſide out of a Ship, the People ſtanding upon the Shore; and he never declined Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to more or fewer in any convenient place ſuitable to the Occaſion. The places in which the Nonconformiſts preach, ſome of them are goodly Edifices, ſome of them are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chappels, the meaneſt of them are not naturally indecent, they beſt ſuit with their Circumſtances; and God being graciouſly preſent with them, the places where they aſſemble muſt needs be <hi>the Houſe of God, and the Gate of Heaven,</hi> Gen. 28. 10, to 18. Get them free leave to exerciſe their Miniſtry in the Churches, and they will willingly quit their Barns and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47268:4"/> other places; but if you exclude them from the Churches, you neceſſitate them to preach in other places; and by valuing the Word for the ſake of the Place, rather than the Place for the ſake of the Word, you declare that indeed you do not truly value God's Word. As it was no ſhame to Chriſt to be born in a Stable, nor to his Virgin-Mother, becauſe it was not their Sin but their Calamity, but all the Shame was to thoſe that thruſt them into the Stable: ſo it is no Shame for God's Miniſters and People to worſhip him in a Barn, when they have no fitter Place to worſhip him in; but the Shame is to thoſe that might allow them better Places to worſhip God in, and will not, but thruſt them into a Barn, and then make that a Cloak for their not hearing and joining with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 10.</label> There is no need of the Nonconformiſts Preaching, it doth more hurt than good, it may better be ſpared, the Conformiſt Miniſters are full enow for the People of this Land.
<label>Anſw.</label> I confeſs that if all Places throughout the Nation were ſupplied by able and faithful Conforming Miniſters, as ſome are, there would not be ſuch need of the Nonconformiſts Preaching as now there is; but it is manifeſt to all diſcerning and impartial Chriſtians, that though there is no want of Miniſters, yet there is great need of able, holy, powerful, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and exemplary Miniſters in all the Dioceſſes of <hi>England;</hi> and pious Conformiſts and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts Miniſters have need of each others Labours, and the more humble and faithful they are, the more ſenſible of it. Never to this day did the Church over-abound with able and faithful Preachers, nor will to the end of the World, while the Followers of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> remain in the World, and many are called but few choſen. Good Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> would uſe to ſay, You may as well complain of too many Stars in the Firmament, as of too many good Preachers in a County.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 11.</label> The late Act for Toleration doth only tolerate the Nonconformiſt Meetings, it doth not approve them.
<label>Anſw.</label> It is plain from the Preamble of the Act, that it permits them as <hi>an effectual means to unit their Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects in Intereſt and Affection;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs approve them. For nothing that is not good and laudable, and worthy to be approved, can be an effectual means of uniting Proteſtants in Intereſt and Affection; ſo that the Nonconformiſts have as true Right to their places by the Law of the Land, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts have to theirs, they are both alike under their Majeſties Protection, and do alike ſtand or fall with them and their Government; their Religion is one, they have the ſame common Enemy, and are like to be happy or miſerable, ſtrong or weak, according as they unite in God and their preſent Majeſties, or do not unite.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 12.</label> The Presbyterian Meetings are not true viſible Churches of Chriſt.
<label>Anſw.</label> The <hi>19th</hi> Article of the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares, <hi>the viſible Church of Chriſt to be a Congregation of faithful Men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly miniſtred according to Chriſt's Ordinance, in all thoſe things that of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame.</hi> Now the Presbyterian Meetings are viſibly ſuch Congregations, and therefore it is impoſſible that they ſhould be heretical, ſchiſmatical, and lacking in any thing neceſſary to the being of true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Churches of Chriſt. If we deny them to be true viſible Churches of Chriſt, we ſhall not be able to prove the Conformiſt Churches, true viſible Churches of Chriſt; for my part I am not able, and I deſpair to ſee it ſolidly and ſcripturally proved by any other.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 13.</label> Conforming and Nonconforming Churches are contradictorily oppoſite, as Light and Darkneſs, Chriſt and <hi>Belial,</hi> Heaven and Hell, and therefore both cannot be true Churches.
<label>Anſw.</label> Such as conform to God's Word, and ſuch as do not conform to God's Word in the Subſtance and Foundation of Religion, are contradictorily oppoſite, as Heaven and Hell, the Church of God and the Synagogue of Satan; but they who equally conform to God's Law in the Subſtance and Foundation of Religion, and differ but about circumſtantial things injoined by Man's Law, though <hi>really</hi> and for the main they be both Conformiſts, yet verbally and <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> they differ as Conformiſts and Nonconformiſts; therefore the grand difference is not between Conforming and Nonconforming Proteſtants, but between god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47268:5"/> and ungodly Proteſtants, whether Conformiſts or Nonconformiſts. As for godly Men Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts and Nonconformiſts, they can bear with one another, and rejoice in each others La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and ſincerely though not perfectly deny themſelves, and mind and ſeek the things of Chriſt, and advance his Kingdom; but it is unregenerate, ungodly, Self-ſeeking, Saint-hating, ſenſual and worldly Men, whether Conformiſts or Nonconformiſts, that are the Plague of the Church, and Satan's chief Agents.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Obj. 14.</label> It is fitter that the Nonconformiſts come over to us than we to them, we by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them ſhall harden them in their ſinful Nonconformity, and ſhall diſpleaſe our own ſide, and not gain our Enemy.
<label>Anſw.</label> Be it ſuppoſed that Nonconformity is a Sin, will it therefore follow that we are not to do our Duty to God and them, and all that in us lies ſeek the Peace of the Church and the Publick Good? Rigid Conformiſts confeſs the Points ſcrupled by Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, to be in their own nature indifferent, neither commanded nor forbidden by God, and that the Church may <hi>well</hi> be without them: Moderate Conformiſts confeſs the Church might <hi>better</hi> be without them, if all both Rulers and People could be ſo content: but Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts judg ſome of the things to be flatly ſinful. Now on whom doth it lie to yield? They retaining their own Principles, cannot yield and come over to us; we retaining our own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, may come over to them, and join with them in the Word, and Prayer, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as we have Call and Opportunity; and in ſo doing, we gain them ſo far as it lies in us to gain them, we pleaſe God, which is Motive ſufficient, and cannot but have a good end and effect. If they make an ill uſe of our Condeſcenſion, that is their Sin, for which they muſt anſwer to God, who will not fail to accept and reward our good Deed: and if Conformiſts be diſpleaſed with us for doing our duty, ſhall we therefore deſiſt from it? The queſtion is not, whether they ſin in not conforming? but allowing to each other their different Thoughts and Opinions about Conformity, what is the duty of both ſides as to mutual Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord? They are ſo prudent as in the courſe of their Miniſtry to inſiſt upon thoſe Points in which both ſides agree, as being ſufficient for Edification; and therefore we may ſafely join with them in publick Church-duties as we have occaſion, without receding from our own Principles, without breaking any Law divine or humane: and therefore it will lie at our door if we do not; we ſin againſt one Article of Faith, <hi>The Communion of Saints.</hi>

<label>Anſw.</label> Yes, a famous one recorded in the Harmony of Confeſſions of three Parties of Proteſtants in <hi>Poland,</hi> ſome following the Auguſtan Confeſſion, ſome following the Helvetian Confeſſion, and ſome following the Bohemian Confeſſion; and being ſenſible of the evil and ſad effects of their Diviſions, the leading Men of each Party came to an Agreement as to Doctrine and Points of Faith, and permitted to one another diverſity in Rites and external Modes, and ſo became one, and did preach, and pray, and communicate with one another, and did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flouriſh in the midſt of Popiſh Adverſaries and Arian Hereticks; and Enemies of all ſorts.
